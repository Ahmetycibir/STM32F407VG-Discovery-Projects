# STM32F407VG Discovery Projects

This repository contains my embedded systems projects developed using the **STM32F407VG Discovery (DISC1)** board.  
Each project focuses on learning and experimenting with STM32 microcontroller peripherals and C programming fundamentals.

##  Features & Topics
- GPIO input/output control  
- External interrupts (EXTI)  
- UART, I2C, SPI communication protocols  
- ADC and PWM examples  
- Timer-based applications  
- Peripheral initialization using **HAL**, **Standard Peripheral Library**, and **Register-level (low-level)** approaches  
- Real hardware testing on the STM32F407VG Discovery board  

---

##  Tools & Environment
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE, Atollic TrueSTUDIO  
- **Language:** C  
- **Board:** STM32F407VG Discovery (DISC1)  
- **Libraries:** HAL, Standard Peripheral Library, **Register-level (direct register access)**

##  About
This repository is part of my journey to master **embedded systems and hardware design** using STM32 microcontrollers â€”  
exploring everything from HAL-based development to **bare-metal register programming**.
